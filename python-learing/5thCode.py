This is the best game ever, and has been developed
by a crack squad of Python experts who haven’t
slept or washed in weeks. Despite being very
smelly, the code at least works really well.
'''
a=10 # Set the start value of A to 10
print("The value of A is,", a) # Print the current value of A
a=a-1 # Player lost a life!
print("You’ve just lost a life!")
print("You now have", a, "lives left!") # Inform player, and display current value of A (lives)
