# This is the best game ever, and has been developed by a crack squad of Python experts
# who haven’t slept or washed in weeks. Despite being very smelly, the code at least
# works really well.
# Set the start value of A to 10
a=10
# Print the current value of A
print("The value of A is,", a)
# Player lost a life!
a=a-1
# Inform player, and display current value of A (lives)
print("You’ve just lost a life!")
print("You now have", a, "lives left!")
